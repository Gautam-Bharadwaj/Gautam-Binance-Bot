#  Binance Futures Order Bot (CLI-Based)

A CLI-based trading bot for Binance USDT-M Futures that supports basic and advanced order types, with robust validation, structured logging, and modular design.

> **Note:** This project is built for educational and evaluation purposes, focusing on clean architecture, safety, and real-world trading logic rather than profit generation.

##  API Setup

1. Create a Binance Futures **TESTNET** account
   -  [https://testnet.binancefuture.com](https://testnet.binancefuture.com)

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
BINANCE_TESTNET=true
```

>  **Never commit .env or bot.log to GitHub**

---

##  Installation

```bash
pip3 install python-binance python-dotenv
```

---

## ▶ How to Run

> **Note:** All commands must be run from the project root directory.

###  Market Order

```bash
python3 -m src.market_orders BTCUSDT BUY 0.01
```

###  Limit Order

```bash
python3 -m src.limit_orders BTCUSDT SELL 0.01 45000
```

###  Stop-Limit Order

```bash
python3 -m src.advanced.stop_limit BTCUSDT SELL 0.01 44800 44700
```

###  TWAP Strategy

```bash
python3 -m src.advanced.twap BTCUSDT BUY 0.02 4 15
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `0.02` | Total Quantity |
| `4` | Number of slices |
| `15` | Interval (seconds) |

###  OCO (Simulated)

```bash
python3 -m src.advanced.oco BTCUSDT SELL 0.01 45500 44500
```

> Places a take-profit and stop-loss order. When one is filled, the other is cancelled.

---

##  Logging

All actions are logged in `bot.log`, including:

-  Order placement
-  Validation errors
-  API responses
-  Testnet limitations
-  Execution status

**Example log entry:**

```
2025-12-30 | INFO | binance_bot | Placing MARKET order | Symbol: BTCUSDT | Side: BUY | Quantity: 0.01
```

---

##  Known Limitations (Important)

Binance Futures **TESTNET** may return incomplete responses (e.g., missing `orderId`) for:

- LIMIT orders
- STOP orders
- Conditional orders

This project detects and handles such cases gracefully instead of assuming successful execution.

> This behavior is logged clearly and explained in `report.pdf`.
