## 🔑 API Setup

1. Create a Binance Futures **TESTNET** account
   - 👉 [https://testnet.binancefuture.com](https://testnet.binancefuture.com)

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
BINANCE_TESTNET=true
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit .env or bot.log to GitHub**

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip3 install python-binance python-dotenv
```

---

## 📄 Logging

All actions are logged in `bot.log`, including:

- ✅ Order placement
- ❌ Validation errors
- 📡 API responses
- ⚠️ Testnet limitations
- 📊 Execution status

**Example log entry:**

```
2025-12-30 | INFO | binance_bot | Placing MARKET order | Symbol: BTCUSDT | Side: BUY | Quantity: 0.01
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Important)

Binance Futures **TESTNET** may return incomplete responses (e.g., missing `orderId`) for:

- LIMIT orders
- STOP orders
- Conditional orders

This project detects and handles such cases gracefully instead of assuming successful execution.

> This behavior is logged clearly and explained in `report.pdf`.
